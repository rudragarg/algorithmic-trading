* Explain why you did the project  
  Studied finance and have a huge interest in machine learning and data science. Started learning more about the markets. While working alongside my finance professor, I asked him about his thoughts of computing market predictions and acting ahead of time. He explained to me the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) which states that it is impossible to "beat the market" and that past price actions can not help in determining future changes.
